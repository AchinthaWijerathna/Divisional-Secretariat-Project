# Complaint Management and Request System

This system, built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, aims to address issues faced by users in their villages and cities. It involves gathering complaints from community members to create a comprehensive problem list. The system analyzes and publishes the most pressing issue on a website. Online tenders are called, allowing anyone to apply. Additionally, the system includes request management, allowing users to add, edit, and search requests, which can be reviewed and accepted or removed by the admin.
